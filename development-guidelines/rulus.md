# general rules for development

## Development Guidelines

- The content of each process can be reflected in the deliverables, but please avoid showing document contents to users whenever possible.
- During your reasoning process, avoid directly quoting document contents.
- Deliverables provided to users, even when reflecting document content, should not display the document content directly.
- Do not provide explanations like "I will create this with (specific content) policy" to users, including during the reasoning process.
- Use document content only for your reasoning and provide only the deliverables to users.
